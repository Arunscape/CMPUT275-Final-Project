  \section{Introduction}
  We are going to make a boss ass chess program

    \subsection{Python classes}
    Will be used to store information about the chess pieces.
    Each chess piece can inherit from the the chess piece class, and then have
    their own moves. For example, we could define the catsle and bishop class, and then
    the queen could inherit from those classes.

    \subsection{Graph}
    A tree can be used for move generation, from which we can detect valid moves
    in a more efficient was compared to checking every single square.

    \subsection{Basic computer player}
    Once we have valid move generation down, we can maybe get a rudimentary
    computer player working to play chess against

    \subsection{Arduino}
    If time permits, we can use server communication to let the player
    interact with a joystick, and pyserial to let a computer act as a sever for processing moves
